React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI project.

Game discovery project where you can search and filter games by genre and platform. Users can also sort the games. Industry standards for data fetching are used as the project uses custom and generic hooks.

Future Updates:
I plan to implement TanStack Query for data fetching, Zustand for global state management, and React Router into the project later on.
this way the project code will be much cleaner and easier to maintain.
